# MUD Rebuild Project

This is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) rebuild project based on the original Gemstone3 MUD code.

## Reference Materials
- Original Gemstone3 code: `/home/greg/gemstone3`
- Gemstone3 core: `/home/greg/gemstone3-core`

## Project Context
- Rebuilding a MUD from scratch using Gemstone3 as reference and influence
- Use the existing Gemstone3 codebase to understand systems, patterns, and architecture
- Reference these directories when suggesting implementations or understanding MUD mechanics

## Guidelines
- When working on MUD systems, check the reference code for existing patterns
- Maintain compatibility with MUD conventions and player expectations
- Focus on modern, maintainable code while preserving the spirit of the original
- Consider both the technical implementation and gameplay implications of changes

## Key Areas to Reference
- Character systems and progression
- Combat mechanics
- World building and room systems
- Item and inventory management
- Social systems and communication
- Quest and event systems

## CRITICAL: Player Stats (FINAL LIST - DO NOT VARY)
The following 10 stats are FINAL and must not be changed anywhere in the codebase without explicit warning:

1. Strength (STR)
2. Intelligence (INT)
3. Wisdom (WIS)
4. Constitution (CON)
5. Dexterity (DEX)
6. Charisma (CHA)
7. Agility (AGI)
8. Logic (LOG)
9. Discipline (DIS)
10. Aura (AUR)

Default stat distribution: 90, 90, 90, 60, 60, 60, 50, 50, 50, 100
Usage: Either <STR 90> or <1 90> assigns 90 to strength
