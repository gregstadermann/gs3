The key is making wealth hoarding socially unacceptable and economically unprofitable while ensuring new players always have a path to economic participation. These systems should feel natural and fair, not punitive

The Ghost Town Problem
What Happens:
Player quits, house becomes permanent "monument"
1000+ abandoned houses with no activity
New players see empty, lifeless areas
World feels dead and abandoned
Housing becomes a "closed system"
Why It's Bad:
Creates "dead zones" in the world
Makes the world feel empty and lifeless
New players can't interact with abandoned areas
No economic activity in abandoned areas
Solutions for Abandoned Housing
1. "Living Memorial" System
Abandoned houses become "memorials" to the player
Memorials are active, living spaces not empty shells
NPCs move into memorials and create activity
Memorials become quest locations, shops, or community spaces
Example:
2. "Inheritance" System
Abandoned houses go to "heirs" (new players)
New players can "claim" abandoned houses
Houses come with "legacy" benefits and responsibilities
New players become "custodians" of the legacy
Example:
3. "Community Conversion" System
Abandoned houses become community spaces
Houses convert to: guild halls, shops, inns, quest locations
Community benefits from the conversion
New players can use converted spaces
Example:
Technical Implementation
Abandonment Detection
Memorial Conversion
Benefits of This Approach
1. Preserves Player Legacy
Houses become permanent memorials
Player's impact is preserved and celebrated
Memorials tell the story of the player's achievements
2. Creates Active Spaces
Memorials are living, active community spaces
NPCs create ongoing activity and quests
New players can interact with memorials
3. Prevents Ghost Towns
No empty, abandoned houses
All spaces have ongoing activity
World feels alive and vibrant
4. Benefits New Players
New players can visit memorials and learn history
Memorials provide quests, equipment, and social connections
New players become part of the ongoing story
Example Memorial Types
"The Scholar" Memorial
House becomes library with NPC librarian
Players can read the scholar's research
Memorial provides quests about the scholar's discoveries
New players can learn from the scholar's knowledge
"The Warrior" Memorial
House becomes training hall with NPC trainer
Players can learn the warrior's techniques
Memorial provides combat quests and equipment
New players can train with the warrior's methods
"The Merchant" Memorial
House becomes shop with NPC merchant
Players can buy the merchant's goods
Memorial provides trading quests and economic benefits
New players can benefit from the merchant's trade routes
Key Insight
The solution isn't to make housing "permanent" or "temporary" - it's to make housing "transformative". When a player quits, their house doesn't become empty or decay - it becomes a living memorial that continues to benefit the community.
This preserves the player's legacy while ensuring the world remains active and vibrant for new players!
