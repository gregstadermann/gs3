# TODO - Player Legacy Systems

## Digital Archaeology

- NPCs who remember and reference past player interactions
- Players can create time capsules with messages for future players
- Hidden caches that players can discover years later through the treasure system (or even small player made trinkets from the past instead of rusty doorknobs)
- NPCs who mourn or remember specific players
- Cemeteries where players can visit the graves of friends

## Technical Infrastructure

- Separate "legacy" database for permanent world changes
- Version control for world state that preserves player impacts
- Backup systems that ensure player legacies survive server migrations

## Decay & Permanence Systems

- Some impacts fade over time (weathering, forgetting) while others are permanent
- Player actions can create "protected" areas that resist decay
- Community efforts to maintain and preserve player legacies

## Environmental Modifications

- Players can plant trees that grow over time and become permanent landmarks
- Carve messages into stone walls that weather (random character is removed from string every year) but remain readable
- Create permanent trails through wilderness areas
- Build bridges, roads, or other infrastructure that becomes part of the world

## Automated Achievement Systems

### Milestone Triggers
- First player to reach level 50 in a class gets a permanent statue
- First player to kill 1000 dragons gets a "Dragonbane" title and memorial
- First player to complete all quests in a region gets a landmark named after them
- Players who die 100+ times get a "Persistent" memorial (honoring their dedication)

### Statistical Achievements
- Top 10 players by total playtime get permanent NPCs based on their characters
- Players with highest skill ranks in specific areas become "masters" with permanent recognition
- Most helpful players (based on assist/kill ratios) get community service monuments

## Economic & Social Systems

### Player-Driven Economics
- Players who establish successful trade routes get permanent "merchant" NPCs
- First player to reach 1 million gold gets a permanent bank named after them
- Players who donate large amounts to guilds get permanent guild halls

### Social Recognition
- Players with highest "friend count" or social interactions get community leader status (BEFRIEND verb?)
- Players who help the most newbies get "mentor" monuments
- Players who organize the most successful events get permanent festival recognition

## Combat & Adventure Systems

### Combat Achievements
- Players who defeat legendary bosses get permanent boss memorials
- Players who survive the longest in dangerous areas get "survivor" landmarks
- Players who die in spectacular ways get humorous memorials

### Exploration Systems
- First player to map an area gets it named after them
- Players who discover hidden locations get permanent "discoverer" plaques
- Players who survive longest in wilderness get "ranger" trails named after them

## Community-Driven Systems

### Player Voting
- Monthly community votes for "Player of the Month" get temporary recognition
- Annual "Hall of Fame" elections create permanent memorials
- Player-nominated "unsung heroes" get community-funded monuments

### Crowdfunding Systems
- Players can pool resources to create memorials for beloved community members
- Guilds can collectively fund permanent guild monuments
- Community events can raise funds for player memorials

## Time-Based Systems

### Anniversary Recognition
- Players who return after 1+ year absence get "welcome back" monuments
- Players who maintain characters for 5+ years get "veteran" status
- Players who log in on game anniversary get special recognition

### Seasonal Systems
- Players who participate in seasonal events get permanent seasonal decorations
- Players who complete holiday quests get permanent holiday monuments
- Players who survive seasonal disasters get "survivor" recognition

## Automated Content Generation

### AI-Generated Memorials
- System automatically creates NPCs based on player behavior patterns
- AI generates stories about legendary players based on their actions
- System creates permanent quests referencing past player achievements

### Dynamic World Building
- Player actions automatically modify world descriptions over time
- System creates permanent environmental changes based on player behavior
- AI generates permanent lore based on player interactions

## Technical Implementation

### Automated Triggers
- Database queries that automatically detect achievement milestones
- Event-driven systems that create memorials when conditions are met
- Scheduled jobs that check for players deserving recognition

### Resource Management
- Automatic allocation of "memorial slots" based on player population
- Decay systems that remove old memorials to make room for new ones
- Tiered recognition systems (local, regional, global)

### Community Integration
- Player-driven nomination systems
- Automated voting mechanisms
- Community resource pooling for memorials

## Examples of Organic Systems

### "The Persistent" Memorial
- Any player who dies 100+ times gets an automatic memorial
- Memorial grows more elaborate based on death count
- Other players can "pay respects" to increase memorial size

### "The Explorer" Trail System
- First player to visit 1000 unique rooms gets a trail named after them
- Trail becomes permanent part of world navigation
- Other players can follow the trail and see the explorer's name

### "The Mentor" Guild Hall
- Players who help 50+ newbies get automatic guild hall recognition
- Hall becomes permanent gathering place for new players
- Mentor's name appears in guild hall descriptions

### "Storytelling" Backend
- Generates NPCs and plot lines on the fly based on player behavior

**Key Principle**: Making these systems transparent, fair, and achievable by any dedicated player - not just the elite or GM favorites. Every player should have a realistic path to leaving their mark on the world through consistent play, helpful behavior, or unique achievements.
