Vigilant guardsmen scrutinize the citizens and travelers arriving and departing through the wide gates spanning the land route into Wehnimer's Landing.  The frenetic pace of the city to the south is a far cry from the deceptive calm of the wilds of Elanith outside.  Two daunting towers survey the countryside and protect the town, flanking the road to the east and west.  You also see a large wooden barrel.

The cobbled road girds the town along the inner side of the northern palisade.  Just to the north stand the twin sentinels of the gate's guardtowers.  Guardsmen come and go through the main gates, keeping a close eye on the people of all races who move to and fro.  Opposite the gates, you see the shop of Dakris the Furrier.

Guards and militiamen pass by, moving between the barracks and the guard towers at either end of the north road.  The broad cobblestoned way proceeds east and west, hugging the inside of the northern wall.  A varied mix of citizens and visitors, including wealthy merchants and their wives, grizzled-looking trappers with freshly-cured pelts slung over their shoulders, and many others who have come to seek their fortunes in Wehnimer's Landing, walk among the ever-vigilant guardsmen.  You also see a small warehouse and a squalid canvas pavilion.
Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
Worn and uneven paving stones broken by deep ruts cover the road here, making for treacherous footing.  A chorus of sounds emanates from the south and west, as the hum of the bazaar melds with the cries of the traders and hawkers and the singsong of vendors and peddlers.  You also see a red-bricked pathway.
Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
North Ring Road intersects here with a cobbled street of modest dimensions that opens up to the south, where traffic becomes markedly more dense along the routes to the main square.  Towards the east, the guardtowers at the river gates can be seen in the distance.  You also see a cobblestone path.
Obvious paths: east, south, west

The east-west road continues, closed in on the south by the militia barracks and on the north by the twelve-foot-high wall of the city itself.  The insistent thud of leather boots in unison upon cobbled pavement and the clipped shouts of barked orders reverberate off the modwir walls along this part of the road.  The scents of leather, weapon oil and hearty cooking fill the air here.  You also see the town barracks.
Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
Here along the main north road, the roughhewn logs of the modwir wood palisade echo passing footsteps on the bumpy cobbled path.  The clammy, briny breeze from the nearby bay fills the air in spite of the sturdy barricade.  You also see a crenellated stone fortress.

The perimeter road runs just inside the protective palisades that protect the north wall of the town, affording shelter from the prevailing winds off Darkstone Bay.  The weathered facades of businesses and warehouses line the road leading south into the center of Wehnimer's Landing.  To the east, the road leads to the riverfront, and the town's main gates lie farther to the west.  You also see a dwarven recruiter.

The west river guardtower looms overhead, marking the end of the road just to the east.  Most of the people passing by here are in uniforms of the various divisions of the town's guards or militia, and even the businesses on the south side of the street seem to cater almost exclusively to military types.  You also see an elegant white brick building.
Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, Bay's Watch West]
Here at the northern end of Wehnimer's Landing, the fickle waters of the Locksmehr River flow into Darkstone Bay.  The westernmost of the twin guardtowers that keep watch over the river gates into town rises above, casting a shadow over the cobblestones.  The huge ironbound sea gates, greenish water plants clinging to them at water level, straddle the river, extending to the matching tower on the eastern bank.  You also see a wrought iron gate and a uniformed doorkeeper.

The faint, tangy scent of the bay mingles with the lighter smells of the river, which runs just to the northeast.  The wide road leads along the riverbank through the warehouse and wharf district, where the sounds of longshoremen loading and unloading freetraders drift over from a wooden walkway to the east.  You also see a painted ashen shop.
Obvious paths: north, east, south

To the east a dock spears out into the waters of the bay.  Ships from all across the world can be seen tied to the dock, and sailors of many races from many lands pass by.  To one side of the road stands a weathered and grey clapboard warehouse.  You also see a small wooden building with a large wooden sign on it.
Obvious paths: north, southwest

Wagons and carts loaded with a variety of goods pass in all directions, from the center of the busy town to the west to the wharfs and piers along the Locksmehr River to the east.  A number of militiamen head north towards the guardtowers and barracks.  You also see a large wooden building with a wooden sign on it.
Obvious paths: north, east, south, west

The large, deserted-looking shed to the east looks as if it once served as a stable or a workshop of some sort.  Now it seems to be nothing more than a crumbling warehouse, and the sparse traffic flowing to the north and south seldom gives it a second look.  You also see a dingy grey stone building.
Obvious paths: north, south
>n[Wehnimer's, Atropa St.]
Here Atropa Street meets Dragonsclaw Road, which traverses the Landing to the south, and combines with Taarna Road to the west.  A gentle rise in the ground affords a glimpse of the hills and open countryside that lie beyond the town walls far to the south.  You also see a secluded stone walkway.
Obvious paths: south, west

The large, barn-like structure that dominates the north side of the block is the city stable.  Through a ground-floor window can be seen the rows of now-empty stalls in the dark interior.  The pavement just outside is strewn with straw and debris that merits a careful step along this part of the road.  To the west is the main square and its cobblestoned bazaar, where furious trading takes place on a daily basis.

At the end of the lane stands a bluestone timber-framed manor house of modest proportions, with a neatly painted cerulean door bearing a polished brass bell.  A small, bronze sign announces, "House Brigatta."  Set into an ivy-strewn curtain wall surrounding an expansive garden is a large, double-doored portal inset with a smaller, subtle wicket gate and a garden path.

The intermittent rhythm of movement through the street to the east and west is accentuated by a constant loud clanging coming from the north, where a column of smoke rises from a towering chimney.  A flatbed wagon has been abandoned here where it collided with the wall of a shabby workshop, and now serves only as amusement for the local children who play on its ruined platform.

Many of the dwellings that line this section of road have shutters closed or curtains drawn to keep out the noise and dust raised by the constant flow of traffic along the street.  Just south of here, the traffic on Cheridin streams west towards the bazaar.  To the east, the lanes twist through neighborhoods composed of serviceable shops and modest residences.  You also see a red and white striped door.
Obvious paths: east, south

Several small shops crowd along the street, which is composed of the back walls of the high buildings bordering the central square.  Each storefront vies with the others for street space and the attention of the many travellers who pass through here.  Other traders, hoping to take advantage of the traffic attracted by the nearby temple, have set up stands and pushcarts spilling over with clothing, trinkets and souvenirs gathered during their travels far and wide.

The constant din of the merchants, tradesmen and hawkers in the shops to the west is muted here.  The cracked pavement, scattered cobblestones, and dirt drainage ditches along the side of the road form a not-so-gradual transition between the bustling avenues of the main bazaar and the less frequented, humbler, and more unsavory sections of the town.  You also see a low stone gate and a tall black bulwark tower.

This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end of the space, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep.  You also see the white Ahirah disk, the Fumbl disk, the Madarch disk, a large acorn, a large acorn, some wide stone benches with some stuff on it, an herbal remedy donation bin, a round silver-banded barrel and a trail of aster-wreathed silver hedgehogs leading southwest.

Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its serpentine lanes abuzz with traders bartering, bickering, and hawking their wares.  The freewheeling vendors in the bazaar provide a lively alternative to the somewhat stodgier merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square.
Obvious paths: north, east, south, west

This corner of the square is lively and hectic.  A number of representatives of the Landing's population, including several elven loggers and a party of rough-looking dwarves, loiter around the door of the Raging Thrak Inn, where the rowdy cheers of patrons and voices raised in songs of many sorts, from snatches of heroic ballads to blushingly bawdy tunes, beckon you to enter.  You also see a polished granite statue and a large wooden makeshift stand with some stuff on it.
Obvious paths: north, east, southeast, south

A small, shady park fills an old vacant lot behind a row of buildings, the bustling sounds of the square filtering through the passage to the north to animate the area despite its appearance of peace and serenity.  A weatherworn grey marble statue of a stocky human in pioneer's clothing overlooks the park, his stone hat encrusted by the gifts of decades of passing birds and his right hand half-upraised as if it once held some now-missing object.  You also see some ornate wrought iron benches and a tall black bulwark tower.

The road bends to conform to the inside curve of the southern and western walls of the high modwir log palisades, which converge here.  A whiff of the scents of the marketplace rises from a narrow lane to the east.  You also see a dark ladder leaning against a large iron-plated tower, a brick pathway leading to an ornate silver gate and an ivy-bordered silver sign.
Obvious paths: north, east, southeast

The lane to the east leads into the heart of town and the main square.  The back wall of the grocer's shop borders the road, its wide door surrounded by piles of rough gunny sacks and stacks of wooden crates, some empty, others still to be unpacked.  You also see a tall mithril postern gate.
Obvious paths: north, east, south
>n[Wehnimer's, West Ring Rd.]
The road passes beneath the shadow of the palisade.  Before you sprawls a gaudily-painted structure, adorned with elaborate carvings depicting scenes of commerce in an almost reverential style.  This is the Merchant's Guild, where the business people of town, from wealthy traders to lowly street peddlers, meet to discuss matters of mutual concern.  You also see a pretty flower girl and a two-story dark brick edifice.
Obvious paths: north, south

You also see a brightly lit small painted wagon and a tall black bulwark tower.
Obvious paths: north, south
>s[Town Square, Northwest]
This corner of the square is lively and hectic.  A number of representatives of the Landing's population, including several elven loggers and a party of rough-looking dwarves, loiter around the door of the Raging Thrak Inn, where the rowdy cheers of patrons and voices raised in songs of many sorts, from snatches of heroic ballads to blushingly bawdy tunes, beckon you to enter.  You also see a polished granite statue and a large wooden makeshift stand with some stuff on it.
Obvious paths: north, east, southeast, south
>s[Town Square, West]
Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned main bazaar, its serpentine lanes abuzz with traders bartering, bickering, and hawking their wares.  The freewheeling vendors in the bazaar provide a lively alternative to the somewhat stodgier merchants whose shops border the square.  The gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank dominates this side of the square.

Foot and wagon traffic swarms off in all directions here, some going to the large intersection with South Ring Road, others crisscrossing the square via the bazaar.  Men and women carrying neatly tied parcels or sacks and coils of rope slung over their arms emerge from the wooden facade of the old general store.  You also see a dark-haired half-elven priestess, a large ebon gate filled with swirling mist, a long oak table with a long piece of cord on it, a large wooden table with a small plate of steel on it, a wide wooden stand with a coil of thick rope on it and a mushy black door.

This broad conduit leading between the south wall and the square hums with the activities of those passing through.  To one side stands a sedate and dignified shop, the scroll-like sign over its door inscribed in a striking and elegant manner.

Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
A small but constant group of local residents gathers around the small well next to the palisade.  They chat idly as the traffic from the connecting road disperses to the east and west, and others with business in the heart of town head north.  You also see a small rustic shop.
Obvious paths: north, east, west

The rough-hewn, pointed logs forming the palisade of the town's defensive wall are a constant companion along this route linking sections of Wehnimer's Landing to the bazaar, the square, and the waterfront via the southernmost road.  You also see a muscular red-armored hiresword and a wide dark mithril gate.
Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
Pedestrians and a variety of carts and wagons move along the cobblestoned road in the shadow of the palisades, most focused on going about their business in town.  They pass by the low wood and stone buildings, rarely glancing up or at one another.  You also see a small white-painted boutique.
Obvious paths: north, east, west

Obvious paths: east, west
>e[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
South Ring Road leads to the outskirts of Shanty Town, the poorest section of Wehnimer's Landing.  The contrast between the colorful, well-kept buildings of the bazaar and main square and the dingy hovels to the east is striking.  Most passers-by move hurriedly to the west or north to the river crossing.  A ragged child cowers against the south wall, looking lost and forgotten.  You also see a shaggy mutt.
Obvious paths: north, east, west

The tracks of wagon wheels rut the path through here, forming tiny rivulets that connect the puddles.  A few sparse bushes and a tiny garden outside one of the shanties do little to relieve the monotony of the otherwise indistinguishable dwellings to the north and east.  The western path leads back to town.  You also see a wide carved wooden archway.

The unpaved layer of mud that passes for streets in Shanty Town is treacherous and slippery with seepage from the nearby river.  A few sorry shacks stand cluttered together in this southeast corner, their doors and windows dark with tattered and drawn curtains, holding untold tales of suffering or malice.  You also see a rock-lined path that leads past one of the shacks.

This quiet corner resembles a calm island amid the bustling life of Wehnimer's Landing.  At the west end, a low, broad dome is visible.  In the center of the square, several benches of polished wood and smooth stone surround a sculpture that stands as a sentinel before the Wehnimer's Museum.  Cast in bronze, the work imparts a sense of peace, calm and protection to the landscaped surroundings.  A gold plaque mounted on a gracefully chiseled malachite base stands before it.  You also see an ironwork gate.

A bright yellow awning marks the entrance to the florist, whose windows are brimming with fresh blossoms.  You also see a white monir gate.
Obvious paths: east, south
>e[Wehnimer's, Wisraith Lane]
The laughter of children at play echoes along this pleasant, cobbled street, where clumps of decorative bushes by the roadside add splashes of green to the mostly brown and grey townscape.  A small boy, obviously the quarry in a game of tag, darts by in an attempt to escape from his pursuers.

The eastern road leads closer to the river, which can be smelled but not seen from here.  The southern road constricts as it makes a straight cut towards the modwir palisade that surrounds the town, avoiding the maze-like side streets of the riverfront and Shanty Town, which are haunted by dockworkers, warehouse porters, and wharf rats.  A dusty pile of rubble might have been a building once, but whatever it was is unrecognizable now.

This dingy street is overshadowed by two multi-storied buildings.  At the far end is the unpretentious facade of Beldrin's Gaming Hall, from which the harsh shouts of gamblers, touts, and onlookers echo into the street.
