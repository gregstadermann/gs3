    "description": "The cobbled road girds the town along the inner side of the northern palisade.  Just to the north stand the twin sentinels of the gate's guardtowers.  Guardsmen come and go through the main gates, keeping a close eye on the people of all races who move to and fro.  Opposite the gates, you see the shop of Dakris the Furrier.",

A few simple chairs are randomly scattered along the dirt floor.  Across the room, to the southeast, you see a doorway covered only by a draped velnalin hide.",
