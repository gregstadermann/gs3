As the corridor twists and turns, the patterns carved into the walls change, flowing from spirals that hint at ocean waves, to a more spherical design, which is its own logic and reason.  The light from the ever-present mithril braziers set high on the walls enhances the changing patterns, giving them depth and drama.",
