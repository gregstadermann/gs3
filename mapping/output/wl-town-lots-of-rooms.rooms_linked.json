Several trees are scattered across the lawn, a particularly large one rising near the bridge.  Silvery lions mounted on the stone wall hold glowing, cut-crystal oil lamps.",

Opposite the bar, a circle of leather-cushioned swing chairs hang around an oiled table.  A myriad of silver lions holding glowing oil lamps hang between the racks at varying heights and a long sideboard holding an antique racing game stretches along the west wall.  An assortment of drinks on a silver tray rests near a liveried bartender.  Perched on a sturdy crossbeam is a large silver lion.",
