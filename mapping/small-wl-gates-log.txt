[Wehnimer's, Outside Gate]
Citizens, merchants and assorted dregs of society jostle against you before the great wooden gates of Wehnimer's Landing.  Harried guards and militiamen try to keep the chaos to a minimum, but it is hard to keep track of those entering, let alone leaving, this large trading post.  A dirt path encircling the wooden palisade of the town leads east and southwest.  Nailed prominently to the wooden wall beside the gate is a sign you really should read.  You also see the Wayside inn.
