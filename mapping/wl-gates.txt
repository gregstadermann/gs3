Citizens, merchants and assorted dregs of society jostle against you before the great wooden gates of Wehnimer's Landing.  Harried guards and militiamen try to keep the chaos to a minimum, but it is hard to keep track of those entering, let alone leaving, this large trading post.  A dirt path encircling the wooden palisade of the town leads east and southwest.  Nailed prominently to the wooden wall beside the gate is a sign you really should read.  You also see the Wayside inn.

The muted sounds of loud bartering from within Wehnimer's Landing, and the lonely calls of a pair of mated fenvaoks high up in the air vie for your attention as you march along the outer western edge of the town.  You also see a rolton, a vacillating will-o-wisp spirit that is flying around, a town guard, a tall wooden archery tower and a reinforced large wooden gate.

Clear grassland stretches far to the southwest, a futile lesson in the immensity of Elanith.  To the northwest, the grassy plain gives way to a smattering of pines that dot the landscape.  Immediately east of you looms the high wooden wall of the Landing which provides you with a sense of security against all the unknown things that may lurk in plain and forest alike.

As you stand next to the southwest corner of the Landing, you have an unobstructed view of the plain.  Some distance away you can make out the vague figures of shepherdesses tending their flocks of Rolton -- sheep indigenous to the region.  Further south the grassy expanse turns hilly, eventually terminating in stark mountains that line the horizon.  You also see a wooden signpost.
