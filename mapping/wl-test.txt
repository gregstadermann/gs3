Town Square Central]
This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end of the space, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep.  You also see the Jobelle disk, a large acorn, a vacillating will-o-wisp spirit that is flying around, a tincture of tkaro, a tincture of tkaro, a tincture of tkaro, the Kanamir disk, a tincture of ambrominas, a large acorn, the Hecuba disk, a single arrow shaft, some calamia fruit, a small wild rice and millet cake laced with maple syrup, some wide stone benches with some stuff on it, an herbal remedy donation bin, a round silver-banded barrel and a trail of aster-wreathed silver hedgehogs leading southwest.
Also here: Jobelle, Lady Sofee, Journeyman Danse who is sitting, Viniciuss, Ouendi, Lord Kanamir who is sitting, Maiden Hecuba, Ahseetah, Lachdahn who is kneeling

[Town Square, Northwest]
This corner of the square is lively and hectic.  A number of representatives of the Landing's population, including several elven loggers and a party of rough-looking dwarves, loiter around the door of the Raging Thrak Inn, where the rowdy cheers of patrons and voices raised in songs of many sorts, from snatches of heroic ballads to blushingly bawdy tunes, beckon you to enter.  You also see a polished granite statue and a large wooden makeshift stand with some stuff on it.

[Wehnimer's, Talon St.]
The street runs between the northern palisade and the central square to the south and east.  The traffic is varied here, as shoppers, traders, travelers and merchants mix with the ever-present and watchful militiamen.  The pristine walls of the Stone Baths occupy nearly the entire block.  You also see a brightly lit small painted wagon and a tall black bulwark tower.
Obvious paths: north, south
[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
The road turns gradually at this point as it forms the northwest corner of the city.  The main path curves along the north and west walls, and another leads south between the buildings.  The massive oak and modwir logs of the city palisade tower overhead.  You also see an old weathered cart with some stuff on it.

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
The cobbled road girds the town along the inner side of the northern palisade.  Just to the north stand the twin sentinels of the gate's guardtowers.  Guardsmen come and go through the main gates, keeping a close eye on the people of all races who move to and fro.  Opposite the gates, you see the shop of Dakris the Furrier.

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
Guards and militiamen pass by, moving between the barracks and the guard towers at either end of the north road.  The broad cobblestoned way proceeds east and west, hugging the inside of the northern wall.  A varied mix of citizens and visitors, including wealthy merchants and their wives, grizzled-looking trappers with freshly-cured pelts slung over their shoulders, and many others who have come to seek their fortunes in Wehnimer's Landing, walk among the ever-vigilant guardsmen.  You also see a small warehouse and a squalid canvas pavilion.
Obvious paths: east, west
[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
Worn and uneven paving stones broken by deep ruts cover the road here, making for treacherous footing.  A chorus of sounds emanates from the south and west, as the hum of the bazaar melds with the cries of the traders and hawkers and the singsong of vendors and peddlers.  You also see a red-bricked pathway.
Obvious paths: east, west
[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
North Ring Road intersects here with a cobbled street of modest dimensions that opens up to the south, where traffic becomes markedly more dense along the routes to the main square.  Towards the east, the guardtowers at the river gates can be seen in the distance.  You also see a rolton and a cobblestone path.

The east-west road continues, closed in on the south by the militia barracks and on the north by the twelve-foot-high wall of the city itself.  The insistent thud of leather boots in unison upon cobbled pavement and the clipped shouts of barked orders reverberate off the modwir walls along this part of the road.  The scents of leather, weapon oil and hearty cooking fill the air here.  You also see the town barracks.
Obvious paths: east, west

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
Here along the main north road, the roughhewn logs of the modwir wood palisade echo passing footsteps on the bumpy cobbled path.  The clammy, briny breeze from the nearby bay fills the air in spite of the sturdy barricade.  You also see a crenellated stone fortress.
Obvious paths: east, south, west

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
A respectful quiet blankets this area like the deep shadow cast by the high north wall.  Those people that move along this section of road walk with their heads bowed and speak in hushed whispers in obvious consideration to the local empath, who practices the restorative arts at the strange tent that is set back from the roadside in the middle of an overgrown vacant lot here.
Obvious paths: east, south, west

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
The perimeter road runs just inside the protective palisades that protect the north wall of the town, affording shelter from the prevailing winds off Darkstone Bay.  The weathered facades of businesses and warehouses line the road leading south into the center of Wehnimer's Landing.  To the east, the road leads to the riverfront, and the town's main gates lie farther to the west.
Obvious paths: east, south, west

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
The west river guardtower looms overhead, marking the end of the road just to the east.  Most of the people passing by here are in uniforms of the various divisions of the town's guards or militia, and even the businesses on the south side of the street seem to cater almost exclusively to military types.  You also see an elegant white brick building.
Obvious paths: east, west

[Wehnimer's, Bay's Watch West]
Here at the northern end of Wehnimer's Landing, the fickle waters of the Locksmehr River flow into Darkstone Bay.  The westernmost of the twin guardtowers that keep watch over the river gates into town rises above, casting a shadow over the cobblestones.  The huge ironbound sea gates, greenish water plants clinging to them at water level, straddle the river, extending to the matching tower on the eastern bank.  You also see a muscular red-armored hiresword, a wrought iron gate and a uniformed doorkeeper.

[Wehnimer's, Locksmehr Way]
The faint, tangy scent of the bay mingles with the lighter smells of the river, which runs just to the northeast.  The wide road leads along the riverbank through the warehouse and wharf district, where the sounds of longshoremen loading and unloading freetraders drift over from a wooden walkway to the east.  You also see a painted ashen shop.

To the east a dock spears out into the waters of the bay.  Ships from all across the world can be seen tied to the dock, and sailors of many races from many lands pass by.  To one side of the road stands a weathered and grey clapboard warehouse.  You also see a small wooden building with a large wooden sign on it.

The southern road constricts as it makes a straight cut towards the modwir palisade that surrounds the town, avoiding the maze-like side streets of the riverfront and Shanty Town, which are haunted by dockworkers, warehouse porters, and wharf rats.  A dusty pile of rubble might have been a building once, but whatever it was is unrecognizable now.

[Wehnimer's, Dragonsclaw Rd.]
The road travels roughly parallel to the river's course, skirting the shoreline.  Fishermen, traders, miners, sailors, and townsfolk trek back and forth between the storehouses, shops, docks and offices that constitute the life of Wehnimer's Landing.  You also see a three-story brick building.

A somber shop by the side of the road attracts a picturesque clientele.  Lissome travellers cloaked in forest green and hunters of many shapes and sizes gather outside.  Some have quivers slung across their backs, others hold menacing-looking contraptions of wood, metal and fiber.  A rugged wooden plaque in the shape of an arrow is nailed to the shop door.

The neatly kept shop on the west side of the street looks like a private residence, except for the displays in its bay window of all the latest fashions.  Elm trees cast an intermittent shade over the cobblestones, and a pair of striped kittens scamper in the dappled light.  You also see a grizzled old warrior.

A grizzled old warrior tosses his broadsword into the air; it turns end over end once and falls.  The old warrior positions his body just right so that the weapon lands perfectly in his sheath!!
[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
Pedestrians and a variety of carts and wagons move along the cobblestoned road in the shadow of the palisades, most focused on going about their business in town.  They pass by the low wood and stone buildings, rarely glancing up or at one another.  You also see a muscular red-armored hiresword and a small white-painted boutique.

The rough-hewn, pointed logs forming the palisade of the town's defensive wall are a constant companion along this route linking sections of Wehnimer's Landing to the bazaar, the square, and the waterfront via the southernmost road.  You also see a muscular red-armored hiresword and a wide dark mithril gate.

[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
The ongoing parade of citizenry that passes by seems to take on a special character in this part of town.  Mixed in with the usual denizens, you notice a preponderance of travellers who appear to be pilgrims, priests and monks.  They file in and out of the road to the north.

[Wehnimer's, South Ring Rd.]
A small but constant group of local residents gathers around the small well next to the palisade.  They chat idly as the traffic from the connecting road disperses to the east and west, and others with business in the heart of town head north.  You also see a small rustic shop.

The green and rolling countryside outside the town can be glimpsed through a crack in the south palisade wall.  A cool and refreshing mountain breeze whistles between the logs, freshening the air with a brisk scent of pine.
