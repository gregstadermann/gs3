[Town Square, Southwest]
This corner of the square seems somewhat subdued.  Townsfolk pass through on their way to the shops, the bazaar, or the main well at the center of the square.  Others hurry past, anxious to get home or go on about their business.  You also see a dark-haired half-elven priestess, a cobblestone walkway leading up to a wrought iron gate, a wood-sided shop and a mound of snow.

[Town Square Central]
This is the heart of the main square of Wehnimer's Landing.  The impromptu shops of the bazaar are clustered around this central gathering place, where townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk, conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of Elanith.  At the north end, an old well, with moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded from the moonlight by a strong, robust tree.  The oak is tall and straight, and it is apparent that the roots run deep.  You also see a peppered cotton-crafted goatee, a layered broom bristle beard, a strand of leather, a large acorn, the ice-covered Fayotae disk, an animated falchion hovering in mid-air, a white-bordered red parchment, a pale vellum-wrapped jar, a glass key blank, a dingy blue dollhouse toy with peeling paint, the Sythana disk, a mold-streaked cream dollhouse toy missing shingles, the Heartlass disk, a bone key blank, the Jobelle disk, the Petroff disk, a green-veined red sweetgum leaf, some blue-tinge purple peat moss, a scarlet elf cup mushroom, the discordant Tearieyes disk, a strand of leather, a red gold key blank, a rotund ochre suede dragon with a spiked tail, a leather-scaled onyx dragon washed in gilt highlights, a white-bordered red parchment, a peppered cotton-crafted goatee, the web-draped Soulheaven disk, a touchy luck spirit that is flying around, the translucent quartz Paricore disk veined in burnt umber, a nebulous twilight grey shadowling, a soot-stained chimney dauber, a tall glass of amber beer, a bottle of caramel-colored mead crafted from glass, some wide stone benches with some stuff on it, an herbal remedy donation bin, a round silver-banded barrel and a trail of aster-wreathed silver hedgehogs leading southwest.
Also here: Fayotae, Lord Ghrath, Ketiosin, Sythana, Heartlass, Zilier, Qodron who is lying down, Jobelle who is sitting, Petroff who is sitting, Dexon, Tearieyes, Soulheaven, Brave Soul Wysteri, High Lord Paricore, Lachdahn who is kneeling

The entrance to Tykel's Arms, its heavy door bounded by iron-barred windows, dominates this corner of the square.  All manner of citizens pass by, moving among the solid, multistoried wooden buildings that surround the bazaar.  Just to the southwest can be seen the tree-shaded heart of the square, where citizens and adventurers gather for socializing, healing and rest.  You also see a narrow alleyway.

Traffic to and from the hub of activity in the square to the west passes along the dark street here.  Passers-by guard their valuables closely, glancing into shaded doorways and niches and wary of the press of the crowd.  Two-story buildings of wood and stone line the north and south sides of the cobbled road.   You also see a tiny kitten, a large reddish-brown sandstone shop, a tall black bulwark tower and an ivy-covered white monir tower.

Loud clanging noises come from the yard to one side of the road.  The yard is enclosed by a tall iron gate, welded to which is a peculiar sign in the shape of a horseshoe with crossed hammer and tongs upon it.

The intermittent rhythm of movement through the street to the east and west is accentuated by a constant loud clanging coming from the north, where a column of smoke rises from a towering chimney.

The two- and three-story homes of some of the Landing's middle-class citizens are situated at this bend in Lyon Way.
